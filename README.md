## SteamSA Downgrade
A Linux tool to convert the Steam version of GTA: San Andreas back to version 1.0.

The speediest downgrader you've ever seen!

## Disclaimer
While this tool produces a game that's exactly the same as the original 1.0 copy down to the file hashes, it hasn't been approved for usage on the speedrun.com leaderboards, so I can't endorse using it until I get their go-ahead.

## Dependencies
- GTA San Andreas
- xdelta3

## How to use
- Copy the files to your GTA SAN ANDREAS installation directory and run convert.sh.

## Video tutorial
- Coming soonTM
